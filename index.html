                    <p class="skillsText">My approach to user empathy is to focus on what the user is telling me and leave my assumptions aside. 
                        I then reflect and analyze my findings with an empathy map and/or persona to better understand the user’s goals and needs. </p>

                    <p class="skillsText">Prototyping is such an essential part to UX design, and it also happens to be my favorite part. I enjoy creating mockups of what the final product(s) is going to look like and receiving testing feedback from users. After all, it’s about seeing how effective a product is for the user.

                    <p class="skillsText">The ability to organize information in an understandable manner is critical. Information architecture quickly became my second favorite part of the design process because creating a product that is effective and user friendly is what I always strive for. It’s where design and technology merge to make lives easier.</p>

                    <p>Currently, people have a hard time planning and budgeting for trips and use more than one app/website to do so. Ace travel was designed to allows users to plan, coordinate, and budget for trips all from one place. I focused on the on-boarding process and overall navigation of the app.</p>

                    <p>Hope for Children Foundation was designed to educate, train, and receive donations from website visitors but due its unreliable aesthetic and confusing navigation, users were unable to complete tasks. Information architecture and modernizing the look and feel of the desktop and mobile version were attacked during this project.</p>
